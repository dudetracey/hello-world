Completing the Tutorial

Hi there! I'm a former math teacher. One day, a high school student asked me "when are we ever going to use this stuff?"
And I realized the true answer was "NEVER."
That was right at the start of the pandemic.

Here we are, a long time later, and I am no longer teaching. I'm trying to find a way that math is actually used in the world today.
